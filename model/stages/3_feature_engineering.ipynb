    "## Adding Synthetic Replenishment Data for Accurate Calculation of Credit Debt Repayment Stability (CDRS) Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Before calculating the Credit Debt Repayment Stability (CDRS) ratio, it is crucial to account for all transactions affecting the available balance, especially replenishments. However, the dataset lacks direct information on replenishment transactions, except for specific cases like reversal transactions. This absence introduces potential inaccuracies when calculating repayment stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this issue without altering the data schema by adding new markers, we will synthetically generate missing replenishment transactions. The approach works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Grouping and Sorting**: We group the transactions by account number and arrange them in chronological order to establish a clear transaction flow.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Pairwise Transaction Comparison**: After sorting, we compare each transaction with the preceding one. If the available balance of the current transaction exceeds that of the previous one and the previous transaction is not classified as a reversal or address verification, we infer that a replenishment transaction was missing between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Synthetic Replenishment Insertion**: For each identified gap, a synthetic replenishment transaction is inserted with a calculated amount and timestamp. This ensures that all changes in the available balance are accurately reflected in the dataset, allowing for a more precise calculation of the CDRS ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "By synthesizing replenishment data in this way, we can achieve a more accurate and realistic assessment of credit debt \n",

    "## Credit debt repayment stability ratio (CDRS Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between a customer's spending and repayment patterns and the likelihood of fraudulent activity (`isFraud`). Specifically, we calculate a **stability coefficient** that reflects how consistently a customer closes their credit debt over time, then analyze how this coefficient correlates with fraud probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spending Percentage**: The percentage of the credit limit that was spent between full debt repayments.\n",
    " $$ \\text{Spent Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Amount Spent}}{\\text{Credit Limit}} \\right) \\times 100 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Days Between Resets**: The number of days between two consecutive events where the available balance equals the credit limit (i.e., the debt is fully repaid).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure customer stability, we consider two factors:\n",
    "- The **average spending percentage** between resets.\n",
    "- The **average number of days** between resets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two values are normalized using Min-Max normalization to bring them into the range of [0, 1]. The final stability coefficient is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{CDRS Ratio} = 1 - (\\text{Normalized Spending Percentage Between Resets} \\times \\text{Normalized Days Between Resets}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",
    "- A value closer to **1** indicates a more stable customer (less spending, more frequent repayments).\n",
    "- A value closer to **0** indicates less stable repayment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "We hypothesize that a higher stability coefficient (more stable customers) correlates with a lower probability of fraudulent activity. Conversely, lower stability may indicate higher fraud risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fraud Analysis\n",
    "Once the CDRS Ratio is calculated for each account, we group the accounts into ranges (bins) of stability coefficients and calculate the percentage of fraudulent transactions (`isFraud = True`) in each range. The results are visualized to test the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This analysis can help identify patterns between customer behavior and fraud risk, providing valuable insights for improving fraud detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice to fix and improve\n",
    "- Investigate anomaly in cdrs-ratio range from 0.222-0.333 -- 0.333-0.444\n",
    "- Improve scaling function (when size of input is 1)\n",
    "- Investigate and fix when normalized `avg_norm_days_between_resets` is NaN (reason might be in scaling function)\n"
